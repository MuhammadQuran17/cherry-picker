## What Happens During Execution?

1. **Preparation**
   - (Optional - turned off by default), Configures git user-name/email, remote origin
   - Stashes current changes

2. **Branch Operations**
   - Pulls latest from target branch (fix version)
   - Creates new branch for cherry-pick
   - Fetches latest commits

3. **Cherry-Pick**
   - Applies commits with `-x` flag (preserves original commit reference)
   - Detects conflicts automatically

4. **Conflict Resolution** (if needed)
   - Tool pauses and shows conflict message
   - You resolve conflicts in your editor, SAVE FILES BUT DON'T ADD TO STAGE OR COMMIT THEM !!!!
   - Press Enter to continue
   - Tool stages changes, commits and continues

5. **Finalization**
   - Pushes new branch to remote
   - Creates merge request in GitLab
   - Assigns reviewer
   - Returns to original branch in your local computer's git
   - Cleans up local cherry-pick branch
   - Restores stashed changes
